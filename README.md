Analyze Pinterest data to uncover trends in user engagement, viral posts, content categories and posting strategies using advanced SQL queries.

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing Pinterest data to answer key business questions, such as:
- Who are the most engaging users?
- Which posts go viral, even from accounts with few followers?
- What content categories drive the most engagement?
- When is the best time to post for maximum visibility?

The goal is to derive actionable insights that could help improve content strategies for platforms like Pinterest.
